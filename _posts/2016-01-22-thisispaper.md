Casting is the major technique Ilona uses for repetitive production and small-scale installations. Presented in an installation, her objects evoke an organic and dynamic feeling, they breathe an atmosphere of serenity.

For instance, each of bowls from the Moon collection start as earthenware clay casts of perfect half spheres, which are subtly reshaped after being removed from the mould while not completely dry. This way every piece is gently modify by hand, creating curved surfaces that will never be exactly the same. The modified bowls are then fired, fixing this gentle and unique deformation in time.
