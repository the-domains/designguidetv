<article style=""><h1>toshihiko shibuya's snow pallet 8 at hokkaido obihiro museum of art</h1><img src="http://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/toshihikoshibuyadesignboom04.jpg" /></article>

**japanese artist **[**toshihiko shibuya**][0]**continues his ongoing 'snow pallet' installations with an eighth rendition; this time taking place at the hokkaido obihiro museum of art**. **the work includes, apart from its original components, several new pieces: Z shapes, and three-story forms. 'snow pallet's' principle characteristic is fluorescent paint, which is applied to the bottoms of a range of artifacts, such as the ones above, in order to showcase the snow's vivid reflective qualities.**

once installed, the work is left to sit, and continually changes according to shifts in the environment such as snow levels and types, sunlight exposure, and the general composition of form. 'snow pallet' explores themes of 'symbiosis and coexistence between humans and nature', and seeks to express the climate unique to japan's northern regions. 

**'snow pallet 8â€² is part of the 'art to thinking, art to talking' exhibition at the hokkaido obihiro museum of art, and is open 9:30am to 5pm daily until march 16th, 2016**
