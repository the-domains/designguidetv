Being a very happy owner of an OP1 ensures that this little company from Sweden always has my attention. Their pocket operator modules were a great introduction for novices and musicians alike into the world of composing on the go. And as always their sense of style instantly draws design aficionados to the almost geeky/high grade designed products. What attracted me is the seemingly simple operation in creating little tunes and a lot of options to play around once you have a melody or beat. At an entry price of 67 Euros each these little musical instruments are a no brainer.

> "all pocket operator models perfectly complement each other. From drum machine, bass and lead synthesisers to noise percussion, the six unique units allow you to start a pocket band. Use them separately or connect them together. pocket operators are designed on a single multiple-layer circuit board using high quality components. they all share a compact and durable form factor."
