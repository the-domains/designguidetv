<article style=""><h1>new pocket operators by Teenage Engineering</h1><p>new pocket operators by Teenage Engineering</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2be6a41b238c24e2f4a109a82bd855d07c78fee1.png" /></article>

Being a very happy owner of an OP1 ensures that this little company from Sweden always has my attention. Their pocket operator modules were a great introduction for novices and musicians alike into the world of composing on the go. And as always their sense of style instantly draws design aficionados to the almost geeky/high grade designed products. What attracted me is the seemingly simple operation in creating little tunes and a lot of options to play around once you have a melody or beat. At an entry price of 67 Euros each these little musical instruments are a no brainer.

> "all pocket operator models perfectly complement each other. From drum machine, bass and lead synthesisers to noise percussion, the six unique units allow you to start a pocket band. Use them separately or connect them together. pocket operators are designed on a single multiple-layer circuit board using high quality components. they all share a compact and durable form factor."
