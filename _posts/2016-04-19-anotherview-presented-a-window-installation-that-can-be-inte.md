_Everything within a home can be replaced, the furniture, the color of the walls, but the view as we know is always fixed and static. Anotherview created a portable window for the nomadic house owner that feels the need to discover different places from their home. _

_It starts off with a real window with an embedded screen that has a real time 24 hour view of a place in the world. The window is then connected to an app which allows people to change the time of day and even change views after they purchase them from the catalogue. _

_Here is a brief text from the creators:_

Anotherview is a portable window that has a 24 hour view from our catalogue of places. Each of these views has been captured by filming from a fixed point out of a window and is part of a 365 day catalogue of unique views in the world. Having this window on your wall gives you a brief glimpse of being in another place in the world.

The view from a window is an important element in every house that greatly influences our daily moods and unlike the color of our walls or choice of furniture, it cannot be changed. Whatever you can see from your window, will always be there.

Anotherview transforms your home into a nomadic place, where windows lead to unexpected landscapes or cities to suit however you feel like.The team of Anotherview is constantly collecting new and exclusive views around the world. In a way each view tells a unique story about our time, people, society and the world.

As a contrast to our fast moving and fragmented reality, Anotherview confronts the viewer to take a deep breath and enjoy the slow passing of time with its thousands of little tales of life that happen during 24 hours and to discover a new sense of perception of time and space from the perspective of your home.

Imagine spending a day looking at the New York skyline from a private residence not accessible to the public, admiring the clouds gently rolling down Table Mountain in Cape Town, watching the wild animals of Namibia congregating around the watering hole or getting lost in the majestic grandness of the Canal Grande in Venice. Or you can order a completely tailor-made view of any place you feel like.

Anotherview can conveniently be controlled using an App we provide for iOS and Android devices. Simply install it on your phone, enter in the unique window code once and from thereon change the time of day, synchronise your times or even pick another view. Naturally you can purchase additional days from our 365 day catalogue for your window.
