**british born [michael young][0] has become well-known for his design approach that expresses a pared down aesthetic, without compromising the particular materials which he employs.**

since 1993, the sophisticated minimalist has built a name for himself, most notably for his interest in industrial manufacturing and use of pioneering technology to create furniture and products that highlight both what they are made from, and the methods used to realize them. because of this passion, young became enamored by the momentum of production and innovation in asia. so, thirteen years after establishing his studio in the UK, he made the decision to move to hong kong --- quickly becoming one of the most exciting and innovative design studios operating on the continent soon after his arrival. 

Young's work captures ties between the local industry and design scene, exemplifying the skills of asia's industrial innovation. seamlessly blending east and west, his practice transcends design by employing some of the highest and most innovative manufacturing skills available. One of his preferred mediums which he has used extensively --- combining it with his talent to create both mass produced and limited editions --- is aluminium.
