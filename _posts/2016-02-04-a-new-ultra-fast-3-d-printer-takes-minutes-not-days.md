description: "The problem with the 3-D printer \"revolution\" is that it's so slow. A regular 3-D printer takes hours or days to output a large and complex shape. That's fine if all you want is to print a replacement button for your jacket, but if you want to manufacture, say, prosthetic arms for fast-growing kids, then time matters."
