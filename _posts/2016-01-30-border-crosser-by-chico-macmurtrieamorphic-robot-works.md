description: 'ZERO1 is thrilled to commission artist Chico MacMurtrie/Amorphic Robot Works(ARW) during the week leading up to SB50. Rising 40 feet from the ground and arching across an imaginary border before forming a bridge and touching down on the "other side," Border Crosser is the first of a series of large-scale inflatable robotic sculptures that poetically explore the notion of borders by artist Chico MacMurtrie/ARW.'
