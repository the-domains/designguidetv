<article style=""><h1>Mind the Map: a Book about Charting the Uncharted and Mapping the Familiar | Yatzer</h1><p> The featured maps vary from the hand-illustrated city guides of Libby VanderPloeg, to the etchings of Mychael Barratt, and from the simple modular forms of Cruschiform, to the retro-futuristic, cartoon-inspired pieces of Mads Berg, plus countless other artists and mediums in between. This book exemplifies the fact that there are as many and as varied maps as there are artists, proving that maps are unique, personal interpretations of our surroundings according to the artistsâ€™ viewpoint.</p><img src="https://www.yatzer.com/sites/default/files/media/slideshow/f3_mindthemap_gestalten_cruschiform_neighborhood_toronto_canada_2014_yatzer.jpg" /></article>
