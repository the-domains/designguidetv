One of the most impressive installations of this years Milan design week was at Chiostro Minore di San Simpliciano in the heart of the city. The exhibition Minecraft15 presented some of the best contemporary artists and designers in an amazing setting created by Danish/Italian design studio GamFratesi who was also in charge of the curating. The floors of the cloister were covered with a reflective surface creating an 'in between' space which was this years' theme.
