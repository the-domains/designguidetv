description: "Says Nendo, \"Many character goods have been made based on the film, with many based on 2D image manipulation. So we wanted to open up new possibilities by creating a simplified 3D form. For example, a consecutive repetition of Darth Vader's concave eyes and mouth turned the object into the instantly recognizable character from every angle.\""
