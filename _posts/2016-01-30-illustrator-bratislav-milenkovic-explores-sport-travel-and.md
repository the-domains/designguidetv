<article style=""><h1>Illustrator Bratislav Milenkovic explores sport, travel and industry in recent works</h1><p>With a portfolio of clients that includes _New Scientist, The Guardian, Bloomberg Businessweek, Delta Airlines_ and _EasyJet_, Belgrade-based illustrator Bratislav Milenkovic had a busy 2015. Bratislav's recent works see him applying his signature use of abstract shapes and ornate compositions to themes spanning from sport and travel to technology and packaging.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bff4be05a1c8abe0c5acc1fb0271c82854d0b8f5.jpg" /></article>

Bratislav's work for United Airlines includes cover illustrations for Dossier, part of the airline's inflight magazine. Exploring localised symbolism and iconography, the designer's vibrant illustrations reflect different states in the US.

An economic representation of Iowa sees Bratislav using larger illustrations of farming equipment and buildings on a grid layout to instil a sense of production and process, reflecting the state's defining industry, food processing. Juxtaposing his representation of Iowa, Bratislav's cover illustration for the Alabama issue of Dossier sees him returning to his playful and easily recognisable use of human characters within a seemingly chaotic collage of themes that amalgamate to form an abstract map of the state.
