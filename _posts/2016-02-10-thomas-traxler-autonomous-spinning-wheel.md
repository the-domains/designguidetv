description: "Powered by nothing but sunlight and some threads, Thomas Traxlers' \"The idea of a tree project\" shows us how objects can grow during the course of a day. The installation is powered by a couple of solar cells which power the entire device, causing the process to move faster or slower depending on the amount of available light."
