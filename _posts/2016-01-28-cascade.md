Entirely made in Italy and available in only 25 pieces for each of the three colors, CASCADE inspires the collection and viceversa, closing the gap between concept and product. For SS16, in fact, FRISUR employs rich textures and new technical fabrics to create garments that are sleek and minimalist, much like the design object. Stark whites and rich cr√®mes are combined with sky-blues and airy khakis. Blue denim and chambray add workwear and elements of Americana to sophisticated Scandinavian influences.
