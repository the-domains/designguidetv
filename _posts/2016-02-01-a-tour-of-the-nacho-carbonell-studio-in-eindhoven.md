> "I like to see objects as living organisms, imagining them coming alive and being able to surprise you with their behaviour. I want to create objects with my hands, then I can give them my personality. I turn them into communicative objects that can arouse one's sensations and imagination. In short, what I want to create are objects with a fictional or fantasy element, that allow you to escape everyday life." - Nacho Carbonell
