> "Practical solutions exist in the form of adult diapers, but these do nothing to address the emotional side of this common problem"

Julia created a washable textile underwear accompanied by washing elements and a campaign to bring awareness to the subject. The aim: to restore some dignity and a sense of security when leaving the home. Take a look and decide for yourself, is this something you'd rather wear then an adult diaper? 
> 
> Julia explains: "In the end it is not about the end product but the experience and conversation around its cycle of use leading to a change in perspective. Through this project I aim to provoke others to consider moments on the margins that could do with the same attention as our emphasis on designing chairs and lamps."
