# In conjunction with a major retrospective on Gerrit Rietveld at the  
Vitra Design Museum, the curator, Amelie Znidaric, invited five  
designers working in the Netherlands to join a partner from the region  
in developing a design proposal.

For this project, Studio Formafantasma was paired with Ms. Doris Wicki, one of the last people dedicated to the tradition of producing charcoal by the slow burning (5-7 days) of wood. The activity, deeply rooted in Swiss tradition, was economically important when charcoal was produced as a metallurgical fuel, but was banned in the 20th century due to deforestation and CO2 emissions.

Despite the negative connotations, a few charcoal burners are still operating today. The passing of time has, in fact, transformed this elaborate production process into a nostalgic 'happening', often relegated to festive folk events. In other parts of the world charcoal burning is still a reality. In the Congo, for example, charcoal burning threatens the Virunga National Park, one of the nation's biggest natural reserves. Studio Formafantasma drew inspiration from the tension between the dystopian connotation of charcoal, causing pollution and destruction, and its beneficent use in healthcare and water purification. Historians have found evidence that carbon filtration was used by the ancient Egyptians, while in Japan it is still common today to use a few simple charcoal branches to purify tap water. In collaboration with a glass blower and wood carver, the designers produced a series of jars and wooden 'filters'. 

Over the course of a few days spent with Ms. Wicki and photographer Luisa Zanzani in a forest in the surroundings of Zurich, the customized wooden pieces were left burning and deteriorating while the process was documented. The charred remains were further sculpted into a series of elements and added to the glass jars. In addition, a small glass bottle was blown into a hollow carbonized log: the resulting glass becoming opaque and textured where it came into contact with the charcoal, yet maintaining clarity in the rest of the body. 

Alongside the design pieces, black charcoal bread (baked following a traditional recipe to aid digestion) and purified water were served during the days of the event. Participants were invited to 'raise their glasses' to this tradition and experience what this meant in the past: twelve hand-made charcoal drawings made by designer Francesco Zorzi portraying trees burning, polluted cities, fumes and black rain, were on display at the exhibition to highlight the misuse of charcoal through the ages.
