the otherworldly landscapes digitally crafted by [filip hodas][0] transport the viewer into a hypnagogic, hyperrealistic space that defies the physical laws that govern the world around us. since the beginning of 2015, the prague-based graphic designer has been realizing a daily render using programs like world machine, cinema 4D and octane. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9993952e958d8cb85372d0dd726ce15905528eba.jpg)

Each of the compositions intersect nature and artifice through the meticulous, digital manipulation of earthly environments, suggesting surreal interventions by unnatural, alien elements --- a parasitic cluster of pink balloons looms over an icy lagoon; a mammoth, cone-shaped rock formation pierces the ground from above; glossy, crystalline orbs hover above jagged cliffs. the highly-detailed quality of the rendered artworks offer a realistic survey and the possibility of impossible landscapes and scenes. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1653b18893e6432a86a750f1dd37cdbb30803882.jpg)
