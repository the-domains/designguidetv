<article style=""><h1>filip hodas' otherworldly landscapes suggest surreal interventions by alien forces</h1><p>filip hodas' otherworldly landscapes </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/88fb9d0fee10000c5cecfb7c8ec01afd34019377.jpg" /></article>

the otherworldly landscapes digitally crafted by [filip hodas][0] transport the viewer into a hypnagogic, hyperrealistic space that defies the physical laws that govern the world around us. since the beginning of 2015, the prague-based graphic designer has been realizing a daily render using programs like world machine, cinema 4D and octane. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/439297bc-7850-4ba6-8a3d-7503fbc335c3.jpg)

Each of the compositions intersect nature and artifice through the meticulous, digital manipulation of earthly environments, suggesting surreal interventions by unnatural, alien elements --- a parasitic cluster of pink balloons looms over an icy lagoon; a mammoth, cone-shaped rock formation pierces the ground from above; glossy, crystalline orbs hover above jagged cliffs. the highly-detailed quality of the rendered artworks offer a realistic survey and the possibility of impossible landscapes and scenes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc1a52bd-8404-4b07-a341-ea6787a72f3e.jpg)
