**[Dutch designers create new plaids][0]**

TextielMuseum asked Jongeriuslab to coach the designers of Studio Truly Truly and together develop new domestic products for by TextielMuseum. In this way, as an educational institution, we underline the importance of knowledge transfer to a new generation of design talent.
