            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>pocket operators</h1><p>Being a very happy owner of an OP1 ensures that this little company from Sweden always has my attention. Their pocket operator modules were a great introduction for novices and musicians alike into the world of composing on the go. And as always their sense of style instantly draws design aficionados to the almost geeky/high grade designed products. What attracted me is the seemingly simple operation in creating little tunes and a lot of options to play around once you have a melody or beat. At an entry price of 67 Euros each these little musical instruments are a no brainer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/942b60b6e4bd814e07cc4964d381ffa8c082a915.png"></article>]]></description>
