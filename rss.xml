            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Thomas Traxler, Autonomous spinning wheel</h1><p>Powered by nothing but sunlight and some threads, Thomas Traxlers' "The idea of a tree project" shows us how objects can grow during the course of a day. The installation is powered by a couple of solar cells which power the entire device, causing the process to move faster or slower depending on the amount of available light.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df698ea8801434eb52c6590e8ef9e85ae24da90f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mind the Map: a Book about Charting the Uncharted and Mapping the Familiar | Yatzer</h1><p> The featured maps vary from the hand-illustrated city guides of Libby VanderPloeg, to the etchings of Mychael Barratt, and from the simple modular forms of Cruschiform, to the retro-futuristic, cartoon-inspired pieces of Mads Berg, plus countless other artists and mediums in between. This book exemplifies the fact that there are as many and as varied maps as there are artists, proving that maps are unique, personal interpretations of our surroundings according to the artistsâ€™ viewpoint.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/744d8db4e6986bad3c482b6e3ca07c70fda90364.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A New Ultra-Fast 3-D Printer Takes Minutes, Not Days</h1><p>The problem with the 3-D printer "revolution" is that it's so slow. A regular 3-D printer takes hours or days to output a large and complex shape. That's fine if all you want is to print a replacement button for your jacket, but if you want to manufacture, say, prosthetic arms for fast-growing kids, then time matters.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6e5f127748de67865dd27d09e7f74dfa39f1aaf0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
