            <title><![CDATA[pocket operators]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>pocket operators</h1><p>Being a very happy owner of an OP1 ensures that this little company from Sweden always has my attention. Their pocket operator modules were a great introduction for novices and musicians alike into the world of composing on the go. And as always their sense of style instantly draws design aficionados to the almost geeky/high grade designed products. What attracted me is the seemingly simple operation in creating little tunes and a lot of options to play around once you have a melody or beat. At an entry price of 67 Euros each these little musical instruments are a no brainer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2be6a41b238c24e2f4a109a82bd855d07c78fee1.png"></article>]]></description>
