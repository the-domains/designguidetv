The activity, deeply rooted in Swiss tradition, was economically important when charcoal was produced as a metallurgical fuel, but was banned in the 20th century due to deforestation and CO2 emissions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9015596e4dd669c3693a66cddae0d1ae5672781d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
