            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Turkish red & more</h1><p>This documentary shows the inspiration sources of five designers and studio. They were inspired by the museum collection and archives of the Textilemuseum in Tilburg which commissioned them to produce new pieces based on the history of art nouveau weavings, objects from the art deco period, sample books, colouring recipes and blankets. These techniques were re-interpreted by using modern techniques such as laser cutting, knitting, digital printing and knit programming. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9f9eca563346dbcbcd1edbd9455dfe00773370c1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The activity, deeply rooted in Swiss tradition, was economically important when charcoal was produced as a metallurgical fuel, but was banned in the 20th century due to deforestation and CO2 emissions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9bbf43e9509e0ae16cd6ce2243aa04b7d8ce6a90.jpg"></article>]]></description>
